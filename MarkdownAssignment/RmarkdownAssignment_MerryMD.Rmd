## Instructions

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. R Markdown can do the majority of things a typical word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word), but requires a bit of knowledge about how the syntax works. There's a lot of help online, but the things I tended to use most when I first started were the RMarkdown Cheat Sheet and Reference guide (got to Help > Cheatsheets inside RStudio) and the [Markdown syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

For this exercise, I want you to get comfortable using Rmarkdown to generate blogpost-style html pages that describe your project and help introduce some of the plotting techniques we learned in class. As a bonus, you'll get to see some of the benefits of being able to write and code in one place. We'll play with some additional approaches for producing publication-quality documents later in the semester. 



## Introduce your dissertation or thesis

My work aims to assess the degree of landscape change pertaining to a savanna-forest ecotone located in southern Guyana and evalauating the dynamics between wildlife populations and this environment. The three hypothesis questions I am addressing are: Q1) How has the forest-savanna boundary changed over an eighteen-year period? Q2) How does landscape context and configuration at the forest-savanna boundary impact terrestrial wildlife communities? Q3) How does wildlife abundance impact forest dynamics at the forest-savanna boundary?
Due to the overlap in habitat, this region is a biological hotspot, therefore important to conserve. For the local peoples, both habitats are used in their life hiatory and culture, and this precarious balance shifts due to drivers such as climate change (Bovolo et. al. 2012)
I have 2 data sets that I will be incorporating to make a generalized linear model using R to achieve this. The 2 datasets include the remote sensed analysis of this landscape, and camera trap images to gain information on the wildlife activity that is occurring in this region.

## Study Area

My study is specific and the Rupununi savanna-forest boundary in Guyana lends itslef to a landscape time series analysis. This map of my study area includes the country of Guyana with the study area, the boundary with a 70,000 meter buffer around the estimated boundary line. 

```{r studyarea}
#shapefule of Guyana, in South America
guyboundary <- readOGR("C:/Users/Nessa/Desktop/BSU/SpatialDatainR_HES598/GUYdata/GUY_adm/GUY_adm1.shp")
plot(guyboundary)

```

```{r}
#subset of study site
landcover <- raster("C:/Users/Nessa/Desktop/BSU/SpatialDatainR_HES598/GUYdata/GUY_adm/subset2.tif") 
plot(landcover)
```


## Map an attribute of your data

After you've made your study area map, trying plotting some attributes of your data. Remember, there's a lot of functionality that we haven't explored yet so be sure to checkout the package documentation and reference webpages if you're having trouble figuring out how to render the data you'd like to display.

```{r attributeplot}



tv.income.tct <- get_acs(geography = "tract", 
              variables = "B19013_001",
              state = "ID", 
              year = 2018, geometry = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(NAME, "Ada | Boise | Canyon | Gem | Owyhee") )


cty.map <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = id.census.sf, fill = "gray") +
  geom_sf(data = tv.income.tct, aes(fill = estimate)) +
  scale_fill_viridis()
cty.map
```

## Plot your data a differnt way

Throughout this course I will be encouraging you to plot your data in ways that don't require you to generate a map. This might help you see patterns that a map might make hard to detect. It might also help you recognize that your _is_ specifically tied to the spatial arrangement of your data (making maps and spatial analysis a critical component of your project). I use `ggplot2` as the primary means for generating these plots. There's a cheatsheet available for `ggplot2` as well (got to Help > Cheatsheets inside RStudio). I also recommend [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction by Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co). His website has the code for building the plots in his book.

```{r}
med.inc <- median(id.census.sf$income)
#fips_codes comes with tidycensus; using it here to get county names
fips_codes$GEOID <- paste0(fips_codes$state_code, fips_codes$county_code)

id.census.plot <- id.census.sf %>% 
  left_join(fips_codes)

np <- as.integer(id.census.plot$nonprof)
np <- np[np != max(np)]
bks <- log(quantile(np, probs = seq(0,1,0.25), names=FALSE), 10)
bks <- c(bks, log(max(as.integer(id.census.plot$nonprof))))

ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=id.census.plot, 
             aes(x=income, 
                 y = reorder(county, income), color = log(as.integer(nonprof),10))) +
  scale_color_gradient(breaks= bks ,guide="colourbar", name="Num of Nonprofits (log)")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = med.inc)
```

## What did you learn?

Tell me a little bit about how plotting your data spatially versus as a more traditional plot affects your thinking. Did you notice anything interesting about the spatial arrangment of the data? Are there trends in the data that the map makes hard to see? What about interactions. This doesn't have to be exhaustive, I just want you to reflect a little bit on how data visualtizaiton can help clarify your research questions.

**Remember, you can use ? to at the prompt to learn more about a command (e.g., ?plot will tell you about the usage of the plot command). Send me questions if you need help!! Good luck.**
