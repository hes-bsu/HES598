## Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. R Markdown can do the majority of things a typical word processing program (e.g., Microsoft Word), but requires a bit of knowledge about how the syntax works. There's a lot of help online, but the things I tended to use most when I first started were the RMarkdown Cheat Sheet and Reference guide (got to Help > Cheatsheets inside RStudio) and the [Markdown syntax page](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

For this exercise, I want you to get comfortable using Rmarkdown to generate blogpost-style html pages that describe your project and help introduce some of the plotting techniques we learned in class. As a bonus, you'll get to see some of the benefits of being able to write and code in one place. We'll play with some additional approaches for producing publication-quality documents later in the semester. 

**Important: Please save your file into the "MarkdownAssignment" folder in our git project using: MarkdownAssignment_YOURNAME.Rmd as the filename. If you don't you risk overwriting other people's work.**

## Introduce your dissertation or thesis

I am studying recreational trails in sagebrush landscapes, with a particular focus on how climate change will alter patterns and impacts on the landscape. I hope to produce research and resources that can improve adaptive management.  

Rmarkdown will allow you to cite pulished works using `BibTex` style citations. You can learn more about how to do that [here](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/add-citations-to-rmarkdown-report/). You can export the BibTex formatted citations from Zotero, Mendeley, or directly from Google Scholar. Use the Rmarkdown cheatsheet to get the syntax for linking to other webpages.

## Study Area

Tell me a little bit about your study area. Where is it located (state, country). Why is it a good place for your study? Use a code chunk like the one below to generate a map of your study area. You can insert new code chunks by pushing the green "Insert" button at the top of the text editor in RStudio.

My study area is currently focused in the Idaho and Oregon Owyhees, but the specific spatial extent of my research is still to be determined. Two possible sites I am considering focusing on are the Succor Creek State Natural Area and the Oolite Interpretive Trail area near Mountain Home.  Recreation impacts to this region are considered a pressing issue by both agencies such as the BLM and local stakeholders. 

**IMPORTANT: You'll need to make sure that any necessary packages are loaded in the first code chunk (called `setup` in this document) or explicitly reference them using `::` as each time you press the `knit` button initiaties a fresh R session outside of your current environment.**

```{r studyarea}
#HappyTrails <- readOGR("./SHAPEFILES/Urban_and_Foothill_Ridge_to_River_Trails.shp")


#HappyTrails <- readOGR("/Users/Clara/Dropbox/Coursework/Spring_2020/Spatial_Data_in_R/Various_Files/SHAPEFILES/Urban_and_Foothill_Ridge_to_River_Trails/Urban_and_Foothill_Ridge_to_River_Trails.shp")

HappyTrails <- readOGR("/Users/Clara/Dropbox/Coursework/Spring_2020/Spatial_Data_in_R/Various_Files/MarkdownAssignment/Urban_and_Foothill_Ridge_to_River_Trails.shp")


plot(HappyTrails, main = "Boise area trails", 
     sub="Check out the Green Belt", 
     col="blue",
     bg="orange")



```

## Map an attribute of your data

After you've made your study area map, trying plotting some attributes of your data. Remember, there's a lot of functionality that we haven't explored yet so be sure to checkout the package documentation and reference webpages if you're having trouble figuring out how to render the data you'd like to display.

```{r attributeplot}
HappyTrails@data #checking out this data. The trail system name seems like a fun thing to plot. I'll try to make each trail system a different color. 

HappyFRAME<-fortify(HappyTrails) #turn the shapefile into a data frame, so that ggplot can read it. it's a picky eater. sf could have read it as is.

ggplot(HappyFRAME, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, color=HappyFRAME$SystemName)) +
         geom_line()

#some fancy loop fix???
systems <- unique(HappyTrails$SystemName)
color_systems <- c("red", "orange", "blue", "green", "purple", "deeppink4", "darkslateblue", "darkolivegreen", "firebrick", "cornsilk", "seagreen")
plot(HappyTrails[which(HappyTrails$SystemName == systems[1]),], col = color_systems[1])
plot(HappyTrails[which(HappyTrails$SystemName == systems[2]),], col = color_systems[2], add = T)
for(i in 2:length(systems)){
  plot(HappyTrails[which(HappyTrails$SystemName == systems[i]),], col = color_systems[i], add = T)
}
```

## Plot your data a differnt way

Throughout this course I will be encouraging you to plot your data in ways that don't require you to generate a map. This might help you see patterns that a map might make hard to detect. It might also help you recognize that your _is_ specifically tied to the spatial arrangement of your data (making maps and spatial analysis a critical component of your project). I use `ggplot2` as the primary means for generating these plots. There's a cheatsheet available for `ggplot2` as well (got to Help > Cheatsheets inside RStudio). I also recommend [Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction by Kieran Healy](https://socviz.co). His website has the code for building the plots in his book.

```{r}
#I'd like to see the distribution of trail lengths. Seems like that could be informative.

hist(HappyTrails$Shape__Len, breaks= 20, xlab="Trail Length", ylab="Number of Trails", main="Boise Area Trail Lengths")

str(HappyTrails)
```

## What did you learn?

Tell me a little bit about how plotting your data spatially versus as a more traditional plot affects your thinking. Did you notice anything interesting about the spatial arrangment of the data? Are there trends in the data that the map makes hard to see? What about interactions. This doesn't have to be exhaustive, I just want you to reflect a little bit on how data visualtizaiton can help clarify your research questions.

I really struggled to color by attribute. I also found that a lot of the data I was looking for was easiest to find in .kmz format, and I'd be grateful to learn more about how to convert between the two formats. 

**Remember, you can use ? to at the prompt to learn more about a command (e.g., ?plot will tell you about the usage of the plot command). Send me questions if you need help!! Good luck.**
