title: "Computer Software Setup"
---

<br>

Welcome! There's a few things to try and get sorted out *before* our first class. Please plan on bringing your laptop (and a charger if your battery isn't going to hold for an hour) to each class.

<br>

### Please complete these 4 main tasks before our first class:

 1. <i class="fa fa-github fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; Install [**`git`**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) & register for a free [**github** account](https://github.com/) with your `.edu` email address
    - **IMPORTANT NOTE**: When installing **git** on your computer, please do not change the installation location! The default installation location is what you want, and if during the installation you click something like "Change Install Location", it will mess everything up
 
 2. <img src="img/R_logo.png" alt="R" width = "6%"> &nbsp; Install *current* [**R**](https://cran.rstudio.com/) on your laptop
 
 3. <img src="img/Rstudio_icon.png" alt="RStudio" width = "6%"> &nbsp; Install *current* [**RStudio**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your laptop
 
 4. <i class="fa fa-table fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; Make sure you have a spreadsheet program installed on your computer (Microsoft Office, Libre Office, etc.)

Read below for more detailed information on installing the pieces of software we'll need, and platform specific instructions.

## `Git` & **Github** Account

Much of the instruction below is from a great website set up by Jenny Bryan, called *happygitwithr.com*.

 1. **[Register for a free individual GitHub account](https://github.com/)** with your "`@boisestate.edu`" email, and [request the Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack). This will give you unlimited private repositories, among other goodies. Do this ASAP! I think a human vets these requests, so don’t delay making this request. Think a little bit about your username and public profile, I suggest you use a real name and begin to build a scholarly identity in social media and coding, but it’s your decision.
 
 2. Send me your GitHub username so I can add you to the class Github Organization, **hes-bsu** (which is basically our own github "classroom").
 
 3. Please look for an invitation to join the [hes-bsu Organization](https://github.com/hes-bsu) in your email. Once that's all done, we can create and add a private **repo**sitory that belongs only to you. Other students can see this repo, but they cannot edit it. The rest of the world cannot see it, only our class.
 
 4. Setup [**git** on your computer](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html). The **~** is a shortcut, and it means your home directory (i.e., **~** = `/Users/myname` on a Mac, **~** = `C:/myname/Documents` on a PC).
 
`r emojifont::emoji("nut_and_bolt")` *__More about repositories and clones__: The __repository__ is a version controlled-project where the `master` copy lives online on Github. All your changes will get committed and pushed up to that repository. A __clone__ is your `local` copy of the repository (on your computer). You can do whatever you want to your `local` copy, making changes/edits, adding files, etc. and `push` those changes back to the `master` repository on github. The cool thing is you can completely delete your `local` copy (assuming you've already committed/pushed any changes that were important), and the `master` will still persist on github, including a record of all the changes you've made.*

## R & RStudio

**R** and **RStudio** are separate downloads and installations. **R** is the underlying statistical computing environment. **RStudio** is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install `R` before you install **RStudio**. Download and install both of these but in this order:

 1. [**R**](http://cran.rstudio.com/): Get the most current version version appropriate for your machine. It's free.

 2. [**RStudio**](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) is a great platform to work with R (note you need R before you can use RStudio). Please install the most recent version. It's free. It does lots of cool things. We'll talk more about it in class.

### Windows


#### If you already have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on *Help* > *Check for updates*. If a new version is
	available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check which version of `R` you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears in the console indicates the version of `R` you are
  running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display
  which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it. You can [check here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f) for
  more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.

#### If you don't have `R` and `RStudio` installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm).
* Run the `.exe` file that was just downloaded
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Windows
  XP/Vista/7/8** (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install it
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.

### macOS


#### If you already have R and RStudio installed

* Open `RStudio`, and click on "Help" > "Check for updates". If a new version is
	available, quit `RStudio`, and download the latest version for `RStudio`.
* To check the version of R you are using, start `RStudio` and the first thing
  that appears on the terminal indicates the version of `R` you are running. Alternatively, you can type `sessionInfo()`, which will also display which version of `R` you are running. Go on
  the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and check
  whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
  it.

#### If you don't have R and RStudio installed

* Download `R` from
  the [CRAN website](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx).
* Select the `.pkg` file for the latest `R` version
* Double click on the downloaded file to install `R`
* It is also a good idea to install [XQuartz](https://www.xquartz.org/) (needed
  by some packages)
* Go to the [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select **RStudio x.yy.zzz - Mac OS X 10.6+ (64-bit)**
  (where x, y, and z represent version numbers)
* Double click the file to install `RStudio`
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.


### Linux

* Follow the instructions for your distribution
  from [CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux), they provide information
  to get the most recent version of `R` for common distributions. For most
  distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
  `sudo apt-get install r-base`, and for Fedora `sudo yum install R`), but we
  don't recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
  usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least `R 3.4.3`
* Go to the
  [RStudio download page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
* Under *Installers* select the version that matches your distribution, and
  install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu `sudo dpkg -i
  rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb` at the terminal).
* Once it's installed, open `RStudio` to make sure it works and you don't get any
  error messages.
