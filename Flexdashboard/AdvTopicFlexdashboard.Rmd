Goal of the project: 

Create a map of COVID-19 cases in Idaho and the US and compare the rate of spread between the two levels?

Ways to go about this: 
We could do a flexdashboard with three chart spaces where each of us create ones space. 
Chart 1: an example map with mapview for the US
Chart 2: an example map with leaflet for Idaho
Chart 3: an example graph with highcharter of # of cases over time: compare Idaho to the US

Do you guys think this is too much work?
